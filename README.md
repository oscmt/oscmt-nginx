# WordPress Nginx

This repository contains the Nginx configurations used for oscmt. It is modelled after (shamelessly copied from) the series [Hosting WordPress Yourself](https://deliciousbrains.com/hosting-wordpress-setup-secure-virtual-server/). It contains best practices from various sources, including the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Nginx) and [H5BP](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx).

## Usage

Contrary to Ashley's wonderful series I only use a single-site ssl setup for my application and therefore I don't use most of his stuff. This is really meant to be used in connection with the corresponding ansible role from [OSCMT](https://github.com/oscmt/oscmt).
